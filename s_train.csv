Two days prior to admission he started noticing shortness of breath with simple tasks such s climbing a few stairs at home. He also describes a non-productive dry cough and some chest ""tightness"" associated with this increased work of breathing.

According to te patient, his fiancee, and his mother, he was feeling well up until earlier today when his left leg became painful and erythematous. He remembers getting in his car to drive somewhere, and then his next memory is of walking around after the accident. He reportedly was the restrained driver in a motor vehicle accident in which his vehicle hit a tree or a pole. . He was thoroughly evaluated in the ED for any evidence of traumatic injury, and had negative films including a chest x-ray, pelvis films, and left knee films. He had CT scans of the head, C-spine, and entire Torso that did not show any evidence of traumatic inhury, fracture, source of infection, or bone abnormality. On arrival he was noted to be febrile to 104.8, tachycardic, and hypotensive at one point with a blood pressure of 93 systolic. His exam in the ED was remarkable for bbilateral lower extremity edema, and for mild erythema of the left lower leg with leg tenderness. A left lower extremity doppler study showed no evidence for DVT. . An attempt was made at an LP, but the procedure was unable to be completed. Given the patient's high fever, altered mental status, and leukocytosis he was treated for both cellulitis and meningitis. His other labs were notable for a normal urinalysis without any blood or protein, a normal serum sodium, and a normal BUN/Creatinine of 19/1.9. His serum toxicology screen was negative as well. . On further historical review, his fiancee and mother state that he has had lower extremity edema since age 5. This has always fluctuated, but has never disappeared. He has also had the erythema of the left leg twice in the past, and he has been treated with naproxen and antibiotics for presumed cellulitis. The erythema usually lasts for a week, and it never goes above the knee. There is no history of skin breakdown or subcutaneous nodules. However, he reports having occasional skin blisters when his edema is severe. he has no history of hematuria, dysuria, sore throat, cough, SOB, DOE, orthopnea, rash, eye inflammation, urehtral inflammation, joint pains or swelling, and he has not had any easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, or blood clots. .
